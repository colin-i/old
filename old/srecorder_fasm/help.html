		<h1>Screen Recorder</h1>
		<p>
			S Recorder is a tool for capturing the screen. The program is available in open source package or binary package. The program runs on Windows OS.
			This is a 32 bit version.
			<br>
			It can makes compressed videos if <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xvid.org">xvid</a> Video for Windows codec is available at the system.
			Many more codecs can be available at another version.
			Uncompressed videos are also supported.
			<br>
			The capture procedure is designed to eliminate the duplicate frames so if a high number of frames per second is selected and on the screen
			isn't activity, the many duplicate frames aren't included. For this purpouse, a variable frame rate container
			was used in the program: "Matroska Video". To stop the capture it uses a selected stop key (or the default one).
			<br>
			The capture goes to a temporarry file and then is arranged at the end in the mkv file. The bit depth used is truecolor which is 24 bits/pixel.
			<br>
			Other program features:<br>
			1. It has a delay between start of the command and start of the capture.<br>
			2. The frame per second period can be adjusted from 1 to a maximum of 32 frames per second.<br>
			3. The screen is recorded based on coordinates: left,right,tob,bottom.
		</p>
		<p>
			The program has a help command, a codec command and the record command.<br>
			A beep is played when the capture start and when the stop key is pressed.<br>
			To start the capture a "s_recorder r" command will use the default values, but the program has 10 more optional arguments.<br>
			The record command optional arguments are:<br>
			1. -output_file (default, time since 1 Jan 1970)<br>
			2. -temporary_file (default, same, +1 sec if both)<br>
			3. -delay (a number from 0 to 9, default 6)<br>
			4. -stop_key (alphanumeric key only, default 'S')<br>
			5. -fps (a number from 1 to 32, default 25)<br>
			6. -left (32-9000, lower than right, default 0)<br>
			7. -right (32-9000, greater than left, default 1024)<br>
			8. -top (32-9000, lower than bottom, default 0)<br>
			9. -bottom (32-9000, greater than top, default 768)<br>
			10.-FOURCC_identifier (uncompressed if skipped)<br>
			Example: s_recorder.exe r -delay 3 -temporary_file "c:\temp files\temp00" -output_file newvideo -stop_key X -fps 32 -left 100 -right 1000 -bottom 700 -FOURCC_identifier xvid

		<p>The dynamic link library has two functions:<br></p>
		<p>
			1. query<br>
			Arguments:<br>
			a. an array pointer pointer (the dll create the array with the codecs and place the array pointer into this locations)<br>
			Return value: eax: the number of elements
		</p>
		<p>
			2. capture<br>
			Arguments:<br>
			a. pointer to MAIN_STRUCT<br>
			b. pointer to a dword (for total frames)<br>
		        <i>The dll can receive a pointer where to write the total number of frames.
			At the begining, the events needs to be unsignaled. After that the event handle 1 can be used in the program.
			The event handle 1 is signaled when a frame was written on the drive. Then the dll waits for the program to signal the event handle 2.
			Then the dll resets the event handle 2 and the cycle goes until the last frame was written.
			The application needs to have the same behavior: waits for event 1, reset event 1, do whatever, signal event 2, and so on..
			The application function for this in source files is "threadproc" and in the dll it is located ïn the "capture" function
			when it ends to write a frame.<br>
			The application can display the progress frame by frame using this behaviour.<br></i>
		        c. event handle 1 (ignored if pointer to a dword = NULL)<br>
		        d. event handle 2 (ignored if pointer to a dword = NULL)<br>
			Return value:<br>
			eax:<br>
			0 Success<br>
			1 Output file already exist<br>
			2 Cannot open output file<br>
			3 Stop key isn't alphanumeric<br>
			4 Frames per second isn't from 1 to 32<br>
			5 Cannot open the codec<br>
			6 Cannot open the temporary file<br>
			7 Cannot write to output file<br>
			8 Cannot allocate memory<br>
			9 Wrong coordinates<br>
			10 Cannot write to temporary file<br>
			11 Cannot create a device context<br>
			12 Cannot create a dib section<br>
			13 Cannot add a windows hook<br>
			14 Cannot initialize the compressor<br>
			edx (if a warning was detected):<br>
			0 No warning<br>
			1 RegOpenKeyEx failed<br>
			2 RegGetValue for num_zones failed<br>
			3 RegGetValue for first zone%u_frame failed<br>

		</p>
		<p>
			The MAIN_STRUCT is a block of data as follows:<br>
			DWORD: pointer to the file out string<br>
			BYTE: overwrite file out (0 is no overwrite, 1 is overwrite)<br>
			DWORD: pointer to the temporrary file<br>
			BYTE: delay<br>
			BYTE: stop_key (Virtual-Key Code)<br>
			BYTE: frames per second<br>
			WORD: left<br>
			WORD: right<br>
			WORD: top<br>
			WORD: bottom<br>
			DWORD:FOURCC_identifier
